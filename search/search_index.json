This translates the code into an executable that is deleted right after it is run.  <code>go build</code> on the other hand is similar to the gcc. When we run <code>gcc main.c</code> for example an executable is created and in order to run this executable we must use <code>./a.out</code> to run the executable. Similarly, go build creates an executable that is the name of the directory and <code>./go-tutorial</code> runs the executable.</p> Command Description <code>go run</code> Compiles and runs the Go program in one step. <code>go build</code> Compiles the program and creates an executable file."},{"location":"tutorials/go-setup/#part-4-push-your-changes-to-the-remote-repository","title":"Part 4.
